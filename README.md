# Code Quiz Arena

## Description

This is the code quiz arena, it is a simple game designed to test your knowledge about javascript.

- I created this project to provide a metric for your basic understanding of javascript
- the game provides you with a high score that it tracks so you can keep track of your best scores
- a timer is also used to add a sense of urgency to the questions

after choosing an answer it will either turn green or red depending on if its correct or not.
